This copy of the GNU calendar has been compiled with emx+gcc
using the emx 0.9c development tools. It can be used under
OS/2, DOS and Win32.

An up to date copy should always be available as

  ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/gnu/other

To install the GNU calendar:

This version supports internationalization. To use it, set the
LANGUAGE environment variable (for german messages, set it to "de").

For that to work, you must set the LOCALEDIR environment variable to
point to the base locale directory (default is /lib/locale). Into this
directory, you must copy po/de.gmo (german message catalog, for
example) from the distribution as de/LC_MESSAGES/gcal.mo and so
on for other languages.
